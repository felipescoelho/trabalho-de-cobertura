# trabalho-de-cobertura
Budget of a Terrestrial Radioelectric Link:
* Research about DEM disponibilized by NASA's SRTM. [OK]
* Research about the possible computational programs that are capable of importing and exporting DEM, as well as about how to obtain and the proper visualization of a coverage map.
* Implement a script capable of importing topographic informations of a geographic region defined by latitude and longitude.
* Research about microwave opperation antennas and build a table containing the necessary characteristics for the dimensioning of the terrestrial link.
* For the point-to-point communication, implemment by a graphical interface or by a file read the input parameters definition:
  - the receptor and transmitter antenna parameters;
  - the antenna localization inside the geographic region obtained through the DEM.
* Implemment a script capable of graphically representing the topographic profile between the transmitter and the receptor antenna of a point-to-point communication, as well as its line of sight.
For the simulation and critical analysis of the results:
  - Present a map with the topographic information.
  - Choose two geographical locations and trace the topographical profile comparing it with the profile obtained through Google Earth.
